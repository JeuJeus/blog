# About Me

I am currently working as a doctoral student for 'Mercedes-Benz Tech Innovation GmbH' and am doing my doctorate at the University of Leipzig.  
IT-Security and Software Craftsmanship are my passion.  
Enthusiasm for the subject is the best motivator for continued learning.
My drive is to do what makes me happy for a living.
