## Should A"I" / ML be trusted?

> _"A New Zealand supermarket experimenting with using AI to generate meal plans has seen its app produce some unusual dishes [...]" [1]_

Trusting in an artificial "intelligence" and using its instructions unchecked as food - _what could go wrong?_

> "[...] app suggests recipe that would create chlorine gas [...]" [1]  
> "[...] recommending customers recipes for deadly chlorine gas, “poison bread sandwiches” and mosquito-repellent roast potatoes." [1]

Definitely the "[...] greatest way to help Save you Money". [2]  
Additionally, a warning was issued that "the company does not guarantee 'that any recipe will be [...] suitable for consumption'." [1]

### How great that we have Machine Learning now, disguised as Artificial "Intelligence", as a Solution for everything ;)
