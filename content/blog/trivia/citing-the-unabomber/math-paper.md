## Hiding Eastereggs in Footnotes

Laura Pudwell's 2007 paper <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27643011" target="_blank">"Digital Reversal Without Apology"</a> contains an intriguing third quote, as evidenced by the accompanying screenshot.

The asterisk which denotes <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/unabomber" target="_blank">Ted Kazcynski's</a> later success appears harmless, but when considered in the context of a mathematician turned domestic terrorist, it warrants a closer inspection.
Rather, it is evident that this footnote is intended as an Easter egg for those who are familiar with Ted Kaczynski's identity.

### Industrial Society and Its Future

Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski killed 3 people and injured 23 others via 10 mail bombs across the United States. 
He authored the manifesto "Industrial Society and Its Future" (35,000-words) as a social critique opposing industrialisation,
rejecting leftism and advocating a nature-centred form of anarchism.
Currently, he is serving 8 consecutive life sentences.
