_I would like to start another series with this article. An insight into the world of trust issues that arise from a cyber-security perspective in our digital world.
In this first episode, we look at a wonderful thought experiment from the 80s._

## Thompsons Thought Experiment

The general idea [1] is quite simple and stems from Ken Thompson - best known for his work in creating UNIX at Bell Labs.
It is based on the idea that in Languages like C, the Compiler is written in the same Language (C) too.
Therefore, a Compiler is compiled by another Compiler.
The classic "Chicken and Egg"-Problem.  

Let us imagine, that normally the compile function looks something like the following:

{% highlight "c" %}
compile(s)
char *s;
{
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}[1]

Now we introduce a Trojan Horse into the compiler by matching for patterns in the source to be compiled.
Everytime a specific pattern is matched, a Bug is introduced into the binary being created:

{% highlight "c" %}
compile(s)
char *s;
{
    if(match(s, "pattern-unix-login")) {
        compile("login-backdoor");
        return;
    }
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}[1]

Are there any interesting patterns to match?
Thompson imagined, that it would be rather interesting to match the UNIX "login" commands code.  
Therefore one could implement a backdoor into the login functionality not only permitting the correct user passwords, but rather a hidden master-passphrase too.
This would allow an attacker to log into any UNIX system using this binary as any user.  

But you may be pointing out at this time - that this modification to the compiler would not go undetected.
Which is absolutely correct and the exact point where the real elegance of this compiler trojan comes into play:

{% highlight "c" %}
compile(s)
char *s;
{
    if(match(s, "pattern-unix-login")) {
        compile("login-backdoor");
        return;
    }
    if(match(s, "pattern-c-compiler")) {
        compile("insert-both-trojan-horses");
        return;
    }
    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}[1]

The magic lies in inserting both trojan horses into the compiler, when it is compiling a compiler.
Initially a clean C compiler is used to compile the modified Source, resulting in a binary containing the trojan horse.
This compiler is set into place as the official C compiler, and the poisoned Source is removed.
Still the compiler will always add both trojan horses (the UNIX login backdoor and the compiler Backdoor) into any binaries built with it.
But any trace of the attack in the source code is hidden and removed.

## Takeaway

Since, as we stated at the beginning any C-Compiler and therefore any Binary is compiled with a Compiler built from C itself, we need to trust the binaries we are using.
But Thompsons thought experiment clearly points out a gaping hole in this chain of trust.  
Not only have many people speculated about Thompson actually having done this himself.
But rather that Nation State Actors would do everything for a trojan like this.

Fortunately, it's not that simple after all.
It is possible to decompile and analyse any binary.
This is where such modifications would be noticed at the latest.  

We finally enter the realm of conspiracy theories as soon as we go one step further and assume that our poisoned Trojan makes modifications to a decompiler.
These would prevent the decompiler from detecting our Trojan and hide it instead.
But that goes too far.

You find it hard to believe that something like this may occur in real life?
