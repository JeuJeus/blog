_Following up to the first series, this article focuses on one of the aspects in software-development that we can not
control. The supply chain especially in the context of external dependencies, let us dive right in._

## What are Supply Chain Attacks on Dependencies?

Supply chain attacks are the threats that are introduced into the software during the build of the application (as
listed as dependency threats in the image below).  
As the use of libraries and frameworks in modern software development means that set pieces of code and even large
modules are taken over from others, this gives rise to potential threats.  
Specifically, the approach of relying on the security and quality of other people's software and relying on the code
being continuously developed, patched and updated leads to potential security vulnerabilities whenever maintenance is
not carried out (properly).

This aspect becomes particularly interesting as soon as we deal with transitive dependencies - that is, all those
dependencies that are dependencies of a package we are using.

## By Example - JS

In order to understand the impact of the supply chain in modern software development, let us have a look at the JS
ecosystem.
JS is frequently used with npm - the JS package manager from GitHub.
npm is used to set up project as well as installing and management of external dependencies.

Let us exemplary set up a simple Node (the JS Server) project including support for REST.
This is achieved by the following command:

{% highlight "bash" %}
$ npm i express

added 62 packages, and audited 63 packages in 1s

11 packages are looking for funding
run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
{% endhighlight %}

</div>

[//]: # (primitives overused packages -> is odd)

[//]: # (problems introduced by this -> transitive deps, vulns)

[//]: # (examples for hacked packages)

## Takeaways and Mitigations
